## 🧱 Design Philosophy
MonAgent follows a **modular, data-driven, and extensible** design approach:

- 🧩 **Modular** — Each component (scraper, bot, processor, etc.) is isolated and reusable.  
- ⚙️ **Configurable** — Targets, selectors, and output formats are defined in YAML files.  
- 🧼 **Readable & Maintainable** — Clean folder structure and naming conventions.  
- ♻️ **Reusable Across Industries** — One framework can handle multiple websites by swapping configurations.  
- 🤖 **Automated & Scalable** — Supports scheduled execution and bot integration.
